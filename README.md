# CalCounter - A Calorie Tracking Application
CalCounter is a calorie tracking application that allows you to keep track of the foods you consume throughout the day and provide you the total calories of these foods. The Journal contains all your logged meals, which can have the calories edited manually, in case you choose to modify the meal you logged. You may also delete the item entirely. Select the floating action button, to be brought to the 'Add Food' screen to search a database of foods for the item you wish to add to your log. 

The home page also consists of a display of your logged consumed calories beneath todays date. As well as motivational quotes to keep you encouraged.
